# Neyda Gonzalez Flores – Data Analytics Portfolio

I recently completed the UC San Diego Business Intelligence certificate and the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 
This portfolio showcases the school-based projects I completed while learning data cleaning, SQL, Tableau visualization, and analytical storytelling.

## Projects

### Bellabeat Case Study (Google Data Analytics)

A three-part analysis exploring daily activity, intensity levels, and energy expenditure using Fitbit-style data.  
This project includes the cleaned dataset, three visuals, and the full case study submitted for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
